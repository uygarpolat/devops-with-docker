# DevOps with Docker

This repository contains my solutions for the University of Helsinki MOOC [DevOps with Docker](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker) course. It covers the basics of containerization with Docker, along with more advanced concepts suchs as creating multi-container setups using Docker Compose.
